The graphical user interface handles the input and output of Scheme execution. Similar to using \emph  {Emacs} with MIT-Scheme, it is not a REPL. The user is free to place their cursor at any point in the document and execute commands anywhere and in any order. Like building with mud, the user has the freedom!}}{1}}

Simply select the text you want to execute, and you will see a preview of the value if you were to execute the command. However, the command does not really execute (from the user's perspective). Once they let go, if they were to just run the \lstinline {(+ x 1)} command, there would be an error: because \lstinline {x} is unbound.}}{2}}
