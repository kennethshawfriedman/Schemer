A Prototype Debugging Tool for MIT Scheme

## This repo contains:

- SchemerForMacOS: The desktop IDE app, containing
- Playgrounds: just a few playgrounds for early prototyping of Mac-to-Scheme communication.

## Requirements:

Very simply, there are only two: the OS, and the language (dependencies considered harmful)

- MacOS, running 10.10 or higher (OS X Yosemite or higher)
- MIT-Scheme already installed. Follow installation instructions here: [MIT-Scheme from GNU][install]. The location of your installation *shouldn't* matter.
