# Schemer
A Prototype Debugging Tool for MIT Scheme

## This repo contains:

- SchemerForMacOS: The desktop IDE app project
- Playgrounds: just a few playgrounds for early prototyping of Mac-to-Scheme communication.

## Requirements:

Very simply, there are only two: the OS, and the language (dependencies considered harmful)

- MacOS, running 10.10 or higher (OS X Yosemite or higher)
    - and because it's a Cocoa Mac App, XCode is required to build the app (but not to run it)
- MIT-Scheme already installed. Follow installation instructions here: [MIT-Scheme from GNU][install]. The location of your installation *shouldn't* matter.


[install]: https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/


## How To Run

Assuming you are on Mac running a modern version of the OS (10.10 or higher), and you have mit-scheme installed: simply launch the app as you would any other GUI.

You can download the fully built, GUI app here: [Schemer-v0.1][0.1]
