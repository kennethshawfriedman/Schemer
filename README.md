# Toski
A Prototype Debugging Tool for MIT Scheme

![Preview](https://github.com/kennethshawfriedman/Toski/blob/master/Extras/Photos%20and%20Videos/Screen%20Shot%202019-06-19%20at%203.58.52%20PM.png?raw=true)

## This repo contains:

- Toski: The desktop IDE app project
- Extras: containing supplemental files & images (no code)

## Requirements:

Very simply, there are only two: the OS, and the language (dependencies considered harmful)

- MacOS, running 10.10 or higher (OS X Yosemite or higher)
    - and because it's a Cocoa Mac App, XCode is required to build the app (but not to run it)
- MIT-Scheme already installed. Follow installation instructions here: [MIT-Scheme from GNU][install]. The location of your installation *shouldn't* matter.

## How To Run

Assuming you are on Mac running a modern version of MacOS (10.10 or higher), and you have mit-scheme installed: simply launch the app as you would any other GUI.

You can download the fully built, GUI app here: [Schemer.app][release]

[release]: https://github.com/kennethshawfriedman/Schemer/releases/latest
